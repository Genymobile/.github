## üëã Hi there

Our Genyboys and Genygirls look familiar üòä? Yes, we are making the most out of Android since 2011 üí™.

Initially a simple, fast, developer‚Äôs favorite Android emulator when others would take more than the time for a coffee ‚òï to setup and launch a virtual device; Genymotion has evolved into a full-fledged Android platform, available across multiple media both in the cloud and on your desktop.

Our vision ‚ú® is to provide Android capabilities at an affordable price to all stakeholders who have to navigate the Android world, from the newcomer to the all-around expert.
